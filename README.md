## REVIEWS API

This is a RESTful API which I designed and implemented as a project during my time at Hack Reactor as a student of the HRATX51 Cohort.


## Technologies Used:
* Express
* Node
* Cassandra
* Loader.io

## Description:

This API serves as one of three services implemented for the System's Design Capstone. 
Using Cassandra, it serves 20 million lines of data with an average response time of 200ms under heavy load.
